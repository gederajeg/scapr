# scapr

The goal of `scapr` is to provide a set of functions that wrap over the HTML-tag for generating <span style = "font-variant:small-caps;">small capitals</span> strings. I designed this package to help me with the writing of my thesis in R Markdown that deals with lots of small-capitalisation of words to be rendered into MS Word output. The package aims to save time and, most importantly, prevent typo in writing the small capital tag (i.e., `<span style = "font-variant:small-caps;">a small capital string</span>`) over and over again in the R Markdown (cf. Yihui Xie's chapter in [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-syntax.html) about inline-formatting for small capital in R markdown). The `scapr` package can be seen as a complement to the [`lettercase`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lettercase/index.html) R package by Christopher Brown.

## Installation

You can install `scapr` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gederajeg/scapr")
```
## Example

```{r load-package, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(scapr)
library(dplyr)
```


The main function in the package is `scaps()`. It can be used as an inline R code in R Markdown as follows: `` `r knitr::inline_expr('scaps("happiness")')` ``. It will then turn "happiness" into "`r scaps("happiness")`". The alternative is to "pipe" `scaps()` after the target string: `` `r knitr::inline_expr('"happiness" %>% scaps()')` ``, which generates `r "happiness" %>% scaps()`. `scaps()` can also be used to modify strings in a data frame to be printed as table with `knitr` package:

```{r scaps-in-table}
# create the tibble/data_frame
df <- dplyr::tibble(concept = scaps(c("time", "emotion")),
                    freq = c(45, 53))

# print with knitr
knitr::kable(df, caption = "A table with small-capitalised strings")
```

There are three other functions in the package for different font-face types of the small capital string. They are `scaps_italics()` (for `r scaps_italics("italicised small captial string")`), `scaps_bold()` (for `r scaps_bold("boldfaced small capital string")`) and `scaps_bolditalics()` (for both `r scaps_bolditalics("italicised and boldfaced small capital string")`).
