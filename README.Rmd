# scapr

This package consists of one function (i.e., `scaps()`) for turning lower-case character format into <span style = "font-variant:small-caps;">`small capitals`</span>. This function wrap the HTML-tag around a character string input and is designed to be used in an R Markdown document. I designed this function to help the writing of my thesis that deals with lots of small-capitalisation of words.

The development version of the package can be installed via GitHub with [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("gederajeg/scapr")
```

## Example

We can use `scaps()` as an inline R code, e.g. to turn the word *happiness* into small caps, as follows: `` `r '\x60r scapr::scaps("happiness")\x60'` ``. It will then produce <span style = "font-variant:small-caps;">happiness</span>.

Another example is to include another markdown formatting, such as **boldface** (e.g., `` `r '\x60r scapr::scaps("**happiness**")\x60'` `` that results in <span style = "font-variant:small-caps;">**happiness**</span>) and *italics* (e.g., `` `r '\x60r scapr::scaps("*happiness*")\x60'` `` that results in <span style = "font-variant:small-caps;">*happiness*</span>).
